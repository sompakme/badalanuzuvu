It refers to both a duty and a service done for others.<h2>What 2 incidents are described in the gift?</h2>The two incidents described in "The Gift" involve the speaker's father taking the splinter out of the palm of the speaker, and the speaker himself taking the splinter out of his wife's hand.<h2>What does the speaker of the poem remember about his father when he removed a splinter from the speaker's hand?</h2>The speaker recalls how his father once removed a splinter from his palm by merely telling him a story in a low, reassuring voice. Though the speaker was in acute pain, yet his father's storytelling technique helped him forget the pain he was suffering.<h2>Understanding "Those Winter Sundays"</h2><p></p><h2>What is the significance of the title The Gift Outright?</h2>The title refers to the gift which Americans gave themselves after realising after a long-time of residing on the land which was to become theirs. Outright is something without reservation.<h2>What does the speaker realize by the conclusion of Those Winter Sundays?</h2>He realizes that his father made sacrifices for him without expecting anything return, acting only out of love for his family. The poem thus presents parenting as selfless and often thankless work. The family dynamic between the father and son in “Those Winter Sundays” is not especially warm, open, or close.<h2>What is the meaning of Those Winter Sundays?</h2>In this stanza of 'Those Winter Sundays', it seems, the idea that the father is abusive loses a portion of possibility as the speaker admits that his father had been there for him against the “cold” and through preparing his “good shoes,” and because the speaker in his older years describes his father's feelings for ...<h2>Who is the speaker of Those Winter Sundays had the fear of of that house?</h2>It is not directly indicated in "Those Winter Sundays" that the speaker is afraid of his father. He fears the "chronic angers" of the house, but this does not necessarily imply fear of the father himself. What is implied is that he never understood until after the fact how his father was showing his love through deeds.<h2>What does the speaker in the gift mean when he describes his father's voice as a well of dark water?</h2>What does the speaker in "The Gift" mean when he describes his father's voice as a "well of dark water"? His voice sounds deep and soulful.<h2>What theme does the poet develop through word choice in those winter Sundays?</h2>Major Themes in “Those Winter Sundays”: Love, regret, and parenthood are the major themes in the poem. The poet provides some glimpses of his father's struggle. He elaborates how his father used to spend his Sundays dutifully. He takes every pain to bring comfort at home and fulfill his responsibility as a father.<h2>What does the father do for his family in those winter Sundays?</h2>The speaker's father has sacrificed everything—including his emotional relationship with his kid—to provide the basic tools of survival for his family. The speaker's father is just doing what any dad would do by waking up early to light the fires in the house.<h2>Who did the speaker speak indifferently to why?</h2>Maybe the speaker (though he was just a tyke at the time) has something to do with those angers. In this line, we learn that he he speaks “indifferently” to his good ol' dad. We could even say that he's “cold” to his dad—cold as an icy winter morning. The speaker is acting like the weather to his poor ol' dad.<h2>What does the speaker of the poem want to pay his father?</h2>The speaker of the poem pay respect to his father and wants to be a source of joy and happiness for his parents.<h2>What does the speaker mean when he says that he could hear the cold splintering breaking?</h2>He doesn't really ever experience that “blueblack cold” as his father does. He only wakes to find the cold “splintering, breaking.” It's like the cold is something tangible that he can hold in his hand—something that can break. Of course that's not literally true, so we should think of this as figurative language.<h2>What is the imagery of the poem Those Winter Sundays?</h2>In the poem “Those Winter Sundays,” by Robert Hayden, the visual imagery is seeing that the child might be thankful for everything their father does for them, but he/she does not show it as much as they should. In the poem there is proof when he says, “No one ever thanked him”(Line 5).<h2>What is love's austere?</h2>Something it cannot and should not be. At times, love is austere; it is stern and unadorned. It is silent, hidden behind the scenes.<h2>What is the mood of the poem Those Winter Sundays?</h2>The tone of the poem is reflective in nature since it is a man looking back on his childhood with his father. It seems age and time give us wisdom and understanding, which is illuminated by the man talking about how foolish he was when it came to the concept of love in his youth.<h2>What is the significance of the phrase Sundays too in the first line of the poem?</h2>So, our speaker begins by telling us that on “Sundays too” his father woke up early. The most important word in this line is that itty-bitty “too,” which suggests that the speaker's father got up early every day, including Sundays.<h2>What do you think the speaker means by the phrase The land was ours?</h2>Robert Frost once described 'The Gift Outright' as a history of the United States, and this is how the poem begins: the land was 'ours before we were the land's' because the land of the United States had been claimed by Americans even before 'the United States' existed.<h2>What does the speaker say was the relationship between the land and the people in colonial America The Gift Outright?</h2>They possessed the land, but the land did not evoke in them any love or patriotic feelings for it. The land was in their possessions, but they did not really belong to it, because of their sense of alienation from it. Their hearts remained unpossessed by a love for, or devotion to, this country.<h2>What is the summary of the poem The Road Not Taken?</h2>The Road Not Taken is a well known poem about making choices in our life. The choices we make shape us. In the poem, the road symbolizes our life and the path that we don't choose is “the road not taken”. The poet describes his life experience and says that long ago he had two choices to make.<h2>What lines in the poem suggest that it is winter?</h2>The poet says that winter seems to be as lifeless for birds; they die, as they cannot move freely in summer. Fishes in this season become firm in the frozen water, which looks slime and sticky. ... This symbolizes winter as lifeless and gloom season.<h2>Why does the speaker fear the chronic angers of the house?</h2>In the poem “Those Winter Sundays” the reader can conclude that the father battled his own personal demons.
