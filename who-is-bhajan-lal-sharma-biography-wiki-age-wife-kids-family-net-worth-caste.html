The party aimed to promote social justice and equality for the backward classes and minorities in the state. Sharma joined the party in 1996 and contested the assembly election from Nadbai constituency on its ticket. However, he lost his deposit, as he could not secure enough votes. He realized that the party had a limited appeal and influence, and decided to switch to a national party.</p><p>He joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1998 and became an active member of the party. He was impressed by the ideology and leadership of the party, especially by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the then Prime Minister of India.

He took the oath of office and secrecy on 15 December 2023, at the Raj Bhavan in Jaipur, in the presence of Governor Kalraj Mishra, and other dignitaries.

He also became the second Brahmin Chief Minister of Rajasthan, after Harideo Joshi, who served from 1985 to 1988.</p><p>Bhajan Sharma’s appointment as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan was seen as a surprise and a masterstroke by the BJP, as he was not among the frontrunners for the post.
