Of course, <a href=# rel=noopener>Rihanna’s Super Bowl halftime show announcement</a> was amazing. <a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a> recreating the “All The Small Things” music video at a Blink-182 concert to announce that she was expecting a baby with husband Travis Barker was iconic. And Olympic gold medalist <a href=#>Shawn Johnson</a> announced that she was expecting Baby No. 3 with husband Andrew East in the most perfect location: At the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens in front of the Olympic rings.</p><p>All that said, we do love a good surprise too! We were floored in 2023 when celebrities like <a href=#>Paris Hilton</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Ashley Olsen</a>, and Chrissy Teigen shocked the world with unexpected birth announcements, having given no signal that a baby was on the way. And yes, Hilton and Teigen both did it&nbsp;twice&nbsp;in one year.</p><p>Just a few days into 2024, we’ve already seen some super sweet pregnancy announcements from the likes of actress Rose McGiver (at the Golden Globes), country music singer Jon Pardi, and HGTV star Drew Scott. And now we can’t wait for all the announcements to come! Below, we’ve listed every famous figure who announced in 2024 that they’re expecting a new addition to their family.

It was crazy and overwhelming and so hard not to scream it from the rooftops. But knowing I was so early, I was so protective—even with my friends.”</p><p>When she reached the 8-week mark, the couple decided to tell their parents. They gave them “a Hermès box or some sort of box” and said there was a gift inside from Milan Fashion Week.</p><p>“Everyone was like ‘Ooooh Hermes!’ But then they opened it and it had all three of the pregnancy tests [in it].
